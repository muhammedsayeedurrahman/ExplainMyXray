    "keywords": ["domestic violence", "DV Act", "protection order", "abuse", "wife beating", "marital abuse", "shared household"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "Indian law protects women from any form of abuse at home — physical, emotional, verbal, sexual, or economic. You can get a court order to stop the abuse and continue living in your shared home.",
      "practical": "If you are facing domestic violence, you do not need to leave your home. Under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, you have the right to reside in the shared household regardless of whether you own the property. You can approach a Protection Officer, a Service Provider, or directly file an application before the Magistrate.\n\nFirst, contact the nearest Protection Officer (available through the District Women and Child Development Office) or call the Women Helpline at 181. They will help you file a Domestic Incident Report (DIR). You can also go directly to a Magistrate court and file an application under Section 12 of the DV Act. The court can grant protection orders, residence orders, monetary relief, custody orders, and compensation orders. Interim relief can be granted on the very first hearing.\n\nYou can also file a police complaint (FIR) if the violence is serious. Keep evidence such as medical reports, photographs of injuries, messages or recordings showing abuse, and statements from witnesses. Many NGOs like the National Commission for Women also offer free legal aid and counseling.",
      "legal": "The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (DV Act) is the primary legislation. 'Domestic violence' is broadly defined under Section 3 to include physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. An 'aggrieved person' under Section 2(a) includes any woman in a domestic relationship — wife, live-in partner, mother, sister, or daughter.\n\nKey reliefs available under the Act include: Protection Orders (Section 18), Residence Orders (Section 19), Monetary Relief (Section 20), Custody Orders (Section 21), and Compensation Orders (Section 22). Section 17 guarantees every woman the right to reside in the shared household. Breach of a protection order is a cognizable and non-bailable offence under Section 31, punishable with up to one year imprisonment or a fine up to Rs. 20,000, or both.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Hiral P. Harsora v. Kusum Narottamdas Harsora (2016) struck down the words 'adult male' from Section 2(q), thereby allowing complaints to be filed against women respondents as well. In D. Velusamy v. D. Patchaiammal (2010), the Court established criteria for live-in relationships to qualify for protection under the DV Act. Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (now Section 85 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023) separately criminalizes cruelty by husband or his relatives."

    "keywords": ["sexual harassment", "POSH Act", "workplace harassment", "ICC", "internal complaints committee", "vishakha", "quid pro quo", "hostile work environment"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "Every woman has the right to a safe workplace free from sexual harassment. Your employer is legally required to have a complaints committee, and you can file a complaint if you face any unwelcome sexual behavior at work.",
      "practical": "Sexual harassment at work includes unwelcome physical contact, sexual demands, sexually colored remarks, showing pornography, or any other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. It covers both 'quid pro quo' harassment (where job benefits are tied to sexual favors) and 'hostile work environment' (where the behavior makes work uncomfortable or intimidating).\n\nIf you experience harassment, file a written complaint with the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of your organization within 3 months of the incident (extendable by another 3 months). Every employer with 10 or more employees must have an ICC. If your workplace does not have one, or if you work in the informal sector, you can approach the Local Complaints Committee (LCC) set up by the District Officer. The complaint can also be filed by a relative, friend, co-worker, psychologist, or a Protection Officer if you are unable to file it yourself.\n\nThe ICC must complete the inquiry within 90 days. During the inquiry, you can request transfer, leave, or other interim relief. If the complaint is upheld, the employer must take action as recommended by the ICC, which can include termination of the harasser, deduction of wages, or compensation to the victim. Your identity must be kept confidential throughout the process.",
      "legal": "The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) is the governing legislation, replacing the earlier Vishakha Guidelines established by the Supreme Court in Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan (1997). 'Sexual harassment' is defined under Section 2(n) and includes physical contact and advances, demand or request for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography, and any other unwelcome physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature.\n\nSection 4 mandates the constitution of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) for every establishment with 10 or more employees. The ICC must be headed by a senior woman employee (Section 4(2)(a)) and must include an external member from an NGO or a person familiar with sexual harassment issues. Section 6 provides for Local Complaints Committees (LCC) at the district level. The limitation period for filing complaints is 3 months under Section 9, extendable by a further 3 months.\n\nSection 14 penalizes false and malicious complaints, but a mere inability to prove does not constitute a false complaint. Under Section 26, non-compliance by an employer (including failure to constitute an ICC) can result in a fine of up to Rs. 50,000, and repeated violations can lead to cancellation of business licenses. The Supreme Court in Medha Kotwal Lele v. Union of India (2013) directed that the ICC's recommendations are binding on the employer."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "Demanding or giving dowry is illegal in India. If your husband or in-laws harass you for dowry, you can file a criminal complaint. The law treats dowry harassment as a serious crime with imprisonment up to 3 years or more.",
      "practical": "Dowry harassment can take many forms — demands for cash, car, property, gold, or other gifts from the bride's family before, during, or after marriage. If you or someone you know is being harassed for dowry, you should take action immediately.\n\nFirst, preserve all evidence of dowry demands — text messages, WhatsApp chats, voice recordings, emails, or written notes. Keep a record of any items already given as dowry with bills or receipts. If you have witnesses (relatives, neighbors, friends) who have seen or heard the harassment, note their details. Visit a government hospital if there is any physical violence to get a medico-legal certificate.\n\nYou can file an FIR at any police station under Section 498A of the IPC (now Section 85 of BNS) for cruelty and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. You can simultaneously file a complaint under the Domestic Violence Act for protection and monetary relief. For recovery of your Stridhan (gifts given to the bride), you can file a separate civil suit. Contact the Dowry Prohibition Officer in your district or the Women Helpline at 181 for guidance.",
      "legal": "The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 is the primary anti-dowry legislation. Section 2 defines 'dowry' as any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given in connection with a marriage. Section 3 penalizes giving or taking dowry with imprisonment of not less than 5 years and a fine of not less than Rs. 15,000 or the value of the dowry, whichever is more. Section 4 penalizes demand of dowry with a minimum of 6 months imprisonment extendable to 2 years and a fine up to Rs. 10,000.\n\nSection 498A of the Indian Penal Code (now Section 85 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023) deals with cruelty by husband or relatives of husband and is punishable with imprisonment up to 3 years and a fine. It is a cognizable, non-bailable, and non-compoundable offence. Section 304B IPC (now Section 80 BNS) deals with dowry death — if a woman dies within 7 years of marriage under unnatural circumstances and it is shown she was subjected to dowry harassment, the husband and in-laws are presumed guilty (reverse burden of proof under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, now Section 118 of BSA, 2023).\n\nIn Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P. (2017), the Supreme Court laid down guidelines to prevent misuse of Section 498A, including the constitution of Family Welfare Committees. However, the Court in Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar v. Union of India (2018) partly recalled this direction. Stridhan rights are protected and the husband has no right over the wife's Stridhan as held in Pratibha Rani v. Suraj Kumar (1985)."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "Working women in India are entitled to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave for the first two children. Your employer cannot fire you during your pregnancy or maternity leave, and you must receive full salary during this period.",
      "practical": "If you are pregnant and working in any establishment with 10 or more employees, you are entitled to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave for your first two children (reduced to 12 weeks from the third child). You need to have worked for at least 80 days in the 12 months before your expected delivery date to qualify. You can take up to 8 weeks of leave before the due date and the remaining after delivery.\n\nTo claim your benefits, inform your employer in writing about your pregnancy and expected delivery date. You are entitled to a medical bonus of Rs. 3,500 if the employer does not provide free medical care. After returning to work, you are entitled to two nursing breaks daily until your child turns 15 months old. Establishments with 50 or more employees must provide a creche facility, and you are allowed 4 visits to the creche daily (including nursing breaks).\n\nYour employer cannot terminate you or change your terms of employment during pregnancy or maternity leave. If you are dismissed during this period, you are still entitled to your maternity benefit. Women who adopt a child below 3 months of age, or commissioning mothers (surrogacy), are entitled to 12 weeks of leave from the date of handover of the child.",
      "legal": "The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 (as amended in 2017) is the governing legislation. Section 5(3) provides for 26 weeks of maternity leave for women with fewer than 2 surviving children, and 12 weeks for women with 2 or more surviving children. Section 5(5) mandates that the maximum pre-delivery leave shall not exceed 8 weeks. Section 5(4) provides 12 weeks of leave for adopting mothers and commissioning mothers.\n\nSection 4 prohibits employers from knowingly employing a woman during the 6 weeks immediately following her delivery, miscarriage, or medical termination of pregnancy. Section 12 bars dismissal or discharge during maternity leave, and any such dismissal entitles the woman to the maternity benefit or bonus under the Act. Section 8 provides a medical bonus of Rs. 3,500 (as notified). Section 11A (introduced by the 2017 amendment) mandates the 'work from home' option after the leave period if the nature of work permits.\n\nThe Act applies to establishments employing 10 or more persons (Section 2). The ESI Act, 1948 provides parallel maternity benefits for women employees earning up to Rs. 21,000 per month, with 26 weeks of paid leave and medical benefits through the ESI scheme. In Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Female Workers (2000), the Supreme Court held that maternity benefits are not a bounty but a right incident to being a working woman."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "Yes, Indian law guarantees equal pay for equal work regardless of gender. No employer can pay a woman less than a man for the same work or work of similar nature.",
      "practical": "If you believe you are being paid less than a male colleague for the same work or work of a similar nature, you have legal remedies available. 'Same work or work of similar nature' means work where the skill, effort, and responsibility required are the same or broadly similar, even if the job titles are different.\n\nStart by gathering evidence of the pay disparity — pay slips, offer letters, salary structures, or any internal communications that reveal different pay for similar roles. If possible, get written confirmation from colleagues (with their consent) about their compensation. Try raising the issue with your HR department or management first with a formal written complaint.\n\nIf the employer does not resolve the issue, you can file a complaint with the Labour Commissioner or the Inspector appointed under the Equal Remuneration Act. You can also file a complaint with the National Commission for Women. In cases of discrimination by government employers, you can file a writ petition under Article 14 and Article 39(d) of the Constitution. Keep in mind that retaliating against you for raising an equal pay complaint is itself illegal.",
      "legal": "The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 (now subsumed under the Code on Wages, 2019) is the primary legislation. Section 4 of the Equal Remuneration Act mandates that no employer shall pay to any worker, employed by him in an establishment, remuneration at rates less favourable than those at which remuneration is paid by him to workers of the opposite sex for performing the same work or work of a similar nature. Section 5 prohibits discrimination in recruitment based on sex.\n\nUnder the Code on Wages, 2019, Section 3 prohibits gender discrimination in matters of wages for the same work or work of a similar nature. Violation is punishable with a fine up to Rs. 50,000 (Section 54). Article 39(d) of the Constitution of India directs the State to ensure equal pay for equal work for both men and women. Article 14 guarantees equality before law and Article 15 prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex.\n\nIn Randhir Singh v. Union of India (1982), the Supreme Court elevated 'equal pay for equal work' from a Directive Principle to a constitutional right enforceable under Article 14. In Mackinnon Mackenzie & Co. Ltd. v. Audrey D'Costa (1987), the Supreme Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work applies regardless of the designation given to the post, and what matters is the nature of work performed."
