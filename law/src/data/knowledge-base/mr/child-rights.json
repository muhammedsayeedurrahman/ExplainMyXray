    "keywords": ["right to education", "RTE", "free education", "school admission", "compulsory education", "6-14 age", "EWS quota", "government school"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "Yes. Every child between 6 and 14 years of age has a fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighborhood school. Private schools must also reserve 25% of seats for children from economically weaker sections, with the government paying the fees.",
      "practical": "Under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, your child is entitled to free education from Class 1 to Class 8. No school can deny admission, charge any fees or charges (including development fees, activity fees, or uniform fees), or require a screening test or interview for admission. If your neighborhood government school refuses to admit your child, they are breaking the law.\n\nIf you belong to an economically weaker section (EWS) or disadvantaged group, your child can also get free admission in any private unaided school under the 25% reservation quota (Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act). The government reimburses the school. To apply, check your state's RTE admission portal during the admission cycle (usually January-April). You will need income certificate, residence proof, birth certificate, and caste certificate if applicable.\n\nIf a school denies admission, charges capitation fees, subjects children to physical punishment, or conducts screening procedures, you can complain to the local authority (Block Education Officer or District Education Officer), the School Management Committee (SMC), or the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR). The school can face penalties including loss of recognition.",
      "legal": "The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act) gives legislative effect to Article 21A of the Constitution (inserted by the 86th Constitutional Amendment, 2002), which declares: 'The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.' The RTE Act mandates that no child shall be denied admission for lack of age proof (Section 14), no capitation fee or screening shall be conducted (Section 13), no child shall be held back, expelled, or required to pass a board exam until Class 8 (Section 16), and corporal punishment is banned (Section 17).\n\nSection 12(1)(c) mandates 25% reservation in private unaided schools for children from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups. The Supreme Court in Society for Un-aided Private Schools of Rajasthan v. Union of India (2012) 6 SCC 1 upheld the constitutional validity of this provision, holding that it does not violate the right of private schools under Article 19(1)(g). However, in Pramati Educational & Cultural Trust v. Union of India (2014) 8 SCC 1, minority institutions under Article 30 were exempted from this requirement.\n\nThe RTE Act also prescribes Pupil-Teacher Ratios (30:1 for primary, 35:1 for upper primary), minimum teacher qualifications, infrastructure norms, and mandates formation of School Management Committees with 75% parent representation. Under Section 18-19, every school must obtain a certificate of recognition, and non-compliant schools can be closed. State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCRs) and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) monitor implementation under Section 31-32."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "Yes, child labor is illegal in India. No child below 14 can be employed in any occupation. Children between 14 and 18 cannot work in hazardous occupations. If you see a child being made to work, you can report it by calling the Childline helpline at 1098.",
      "practical": "If you know of a child being forced to work, you can take immediate action. Call the Childline helpline at 1098, which is a 24/7 free helpline for children in distress. They will coordinate with police and child welfare authorities to rescue the child. You can also file a complaint directly with the local police, the District Magistrate, or the Labour Inspector.\n\nThe law completely prohibits employment of children under 14 in any occupation or process. For adolescents aged 14-18, employment is banned in hazardous occupations listed in the Schedule to the Act (such as mining, inflammable substances, and explosives). Even for non-hazardous work, adolescents cannot work more than 6 hours a day, cannot work between 7 PM and 8 AM, and must be given weekly holidays.\n\nAfter rescue, the child is produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), which assesses the child's situation and passes appropriate orders for rehabilitation, including education, vocational training, and a rehabilitation fund. The employer faces criminal prosecution. If you are an employer who has unknowingly hired a minor, stop immediately and cooperate with authorities to ensure the child's rehabilitation.",
      "legal": "The Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 (as amended in 2016) is the primary legislation. Section 3 imposes a complete ban on employment of children (below 14) in any occupation or process, with the exception of family enterprises (non-hazardous) and the audio-visual entertainment industry with prescribed safeguards. Section 3A prohibits employment of adolescents (14-18) in hazardous occupations listed in the Schedule. Penalties under Section 14 include imprisonment of 6 months to 2 years and fine of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 50,000 for employing children; for adolescents in hazardous work, imprisonment of 6 months to 2 years and fine of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 50,000.\n\nThe Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (Section 75-76) punishes cruelty to children and employing children for begging with imprisonment up to 5 years. The Factories Act, 1948 (Section 67) prohibits employment of children under 14 in factories. The Mines Act, 1952 (Section 40) prohibits employment of persons under 18 in mines. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 covers situations where children are in bonded labor.\n\nArticle 24 of the Constitution directly prohibits employment of children below 14 in any factory, mine, or hazardous employment. Article 39(e) directs the State to ensure that children are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age. The Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu (1996) 6 SCC 756 laid down comprehensive directions for elimination of child labor, including establishment of a Child Labour Rehabilitation-cum-Welfare Fund with Rs. 20,000 per child contribution from offending employers."

    "keywords": ["juvenile", "child crime", "juvenile justice", "JJ Act", "Juvenile Justice Board", "minor offender", "child in conflict with law", "observation home"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "Children under 18 who commit crimes are called 'children in conflict with law' and are treated differently from adult criminals. They are handled by the Juvenile Justice Board (not regular courts), cannot be sent to adult jails, and the focus is on rehabilitation and reformation, not punishment.",
      "practical": "If your child has been apprehended by police for an offence, know that they have special protections. The police must inform you immediately and cannot keep the child in a regular police lock-up. The child must be produced before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) within 24 hours. The JJB is a special body consisting of a Judicial Magistrate and two social workers (at least one woman).\n\nThe child has the right to a lawyer, and if you cannot afford one, the Legal Services Authority will provide free legal aid. The child's identity must be kept confidential and cannot be published in media. During the inquiry, the child may be released on bail (which is the default for non-heinous offences) or placed in an Observation Home. The JJB will inquire into the matter and consider the social investigation report prepared by a Probation Officer.\n\nFor petty and serious offences, the JJB can order counseling, community service, probation, or placement in a Special Home for up to 3 years. For heinous offences (carrying imprisonment of 7+ years) by children aged 16-18, the JJB may conduct a preliminary assessment and if satisfied that the child has the mental and physical capacity to commit and understand the consequences, may transfer the case to a Children's Court. However, even in such cases, the maximum sentence that can be imposed is for the period until the child turns 21.",
      "legal": "The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act, 2015) replaced the earlier JJ Act of 2000 and governs children in conflict with law (below 18 years). The Act was amended following the Nirbhaya case of 2012, where a juvenile was involved. Section 15 categorizes offences as petty (up to 3 years imprisonment), serious (3-7 years), and heinous (7+ years). For petty and serious offences, only the JJB has jurisdiction and the maximum institutional stay is 3 years.\n\nThe controversial Section 15(1) proviso allows the JJB to conduct a preliminary assessment for heinous offences committed by children aged 16-18, evaluating their mental and physical capacity. If the JJB concludes the child should be tried as an adult, the case is transferred to a Children's Court under Section 18(3). However, the Supreme Court in Shilpa Mittal v. State of NCT of Delhi (2020) clarified that 'heinous offences' under the JJ Act refer only to offences with a minimum punishment of 7 years imprisonment, not just a maximum of 7 years. This narrowed the scope significantly.\n\nSection 3 of the JJ Act establishes fundamental principles including presumption of innocence, dignity, best interest of the child, right to be heard, and non-stigmatization. Section 74 prohibits disclosure of the child's identity. Section 12 provides that bail is the default for petty and serious offences. The Act also establishes Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) under Section 27 for children in need of care and protection. Article 15(3) of the Constitution empowers the State to make special provisions for children, and Article 39(e)-(f) mandate protection of children from exploitation."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "The POCSO Act (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012) is a strong law that protects all children under 18 from sexual abuse. It covers all forms of sexual assault, harassment, and pornography. Reporting is mandatory, and cases must be tried by Special Courts within one year.",
      "practical": "If a child has been sexually abused, the first priority is the child's safety and medical care. Take the child to the nearest hospital for medical examination (free of charge under POCSO). The hospital cannot refuse and must provide treatment. A female doctor must examine a girl child, and a parent or trusted person must be present during examination.\n\nReport the crime immediately. You can call the police (100 or 112), Childline (1098), or go to the nearest police station. Under POCSO, anyone who knows about child sexual abuse must report it -- failure to report is itself a crime. The police must register an FIR and not turn you away. The statement of the child should be recorded at the child's residence or a place of their comfort, not at the police station. The child's identity must be kept completely confidential.\n\nThe case will be tried by a Special Court designated under POCSO. The law provides for child-friendly procedures: the child can testify through a screen or video conference, the defense lawyer cannot directly cross-examine the child in an intimidating manner, the child can have a support person during trial, and the court must be conducted in a child-friendly atmosphere. The Special Court must complete the trial within one year. Compensation for the child can be ordered under Section 33.",
      "legal": "The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act), as amended in 2019, is a comprehensive, gender-neutral law protecting all persons below 18 from sexual offences. It defines and penalizes: penetrative sexual assault (Section 3-4, minimum 10 years to life imprisonment; aggravated form minimum 20 years to death); sexual assault (Section 7-8, minimum 3-5 years); sexual harassment (Section 11-12, up to 3 years); and use of children for pornographic purposes (Section 13-14, up to 5 years, or 7 years for repeat offence).\n\nThe 2019 amendment (POCSO Amendment Act, 2019) introduced the death penalty for aggravated penetrative sexual assault, increased minimum punishments across categories, and added specific provisions for child pornography offences including storage of such material (Section 15). Section 29 establishes a presumption of guilt -- the Special Court shall presume that the accused committed the offence and the accused must prove their innocence. Section 30 creates a presumption regarding culpable mental state. Section 19 mandates reporting by any person who has knowledge of a sexual offence against a child, with punishment under Section 21 for failure to report.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Nipun Saxena v. Union of India (2019) 2 SCC 703 laid down detailed guidelines for protection of identity and dignity of child victims, including use of codes instead of names in court records. In Alakh Alok Srivastava v. Union of India (2018) 5 SCC 1, the Court directed all states to set up Special Courts with child-friendly facilities within 60 days. The POCSO Rules, 2020 provide for mandatory police verification of staff in schools and childcare institutions, and mandate child protection policies in all such institutions."

      "simple": "In India, adoption is regulated by the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA). Prospective parents must register on the CARA portal (cara.wcd.gov.in), complete a home study, and follow a step-by-step process. Both married couples and single individuals can adopt, subject to age and other criteria.",
      "practical": "If you want to adopt a child, the first step is to register on the CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority) portal at cara.wcd.gov.in. Create an account and fill in the online application with your personal details, preferences (age of child, health conditions you are willing to accept), and upload required documents including identity proof, income proof, marriage certificate, medical fitness certificate, and photographs.\n\nAfter registration, a Specialized Adoption Agency (SAA) will be assigned to conduct a Home Study. A social worker will visit your home, interview family members, and prepare a Home Study Report (HSR) assessing your suitability as adoptive parents. This process takes about 3-4 months. Once approved, you will be placed on the waiting list. When a child matching your preferences becomes available, you will receive a referral with the child's photograph, medical report, and background.\n\nYou can accept or decline the referral (you can decline up to 3 times). Once you accept, you will meet the child and a pre-adoption foster care period begins. The adoption is then legalized through an Adoption Order issued by the District Court under Section 61 of the JJ Act. After the court order, CARA issues a conformity certificate. For inter-country adoption (by NRIs or foreigners), additional clearances from CARA and the Central Authority of the receiving country are required.",
      "legal": "Child adoption in India is governed by two legal frameworks: the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 (HAMA) for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs; and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) read with the Adoption Regulations, 2022 for all citizens regardless of religion. The JJ Act route through CARA has become the standard process for most adoptions. Muslims, Christians, and Parsis who could earlier only take guardianship under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 can now also adopt under the JJ Act following the 2015 amendments.\n\nSection 56-68 of the JJ Act, 2015 and the CARA Adoption Regulations, 2022 prescribe detailed eligibility criteria: prospective adoptive parents must be physically, mentally, and financially stable; a couple must have at least 2 years of stable marriage; single parents can adopt (single male cannot adopt a girl child); minimum age of prospective parents is 25 years; the composite age of the couple should not exceed 110 years (for a child up to 4 years). Section 61 requires the adoption order from the District Magistrate (amended from court in 2021), making the child the legitimate child of the adoptive parents for all purposes.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Lakshmi Kant Pandey v. Union of India (1984) 2 SCC 244 laid down the foundational guidelines for inter-country adoption, which led to the creation of CARA. In Shabnam Hashmi v. Union of India (2014) 4 SCC 1, the Supreme Court held that the JJ Act's adoption provisions are secular and available to persons of all religions. The HAMA, Section 5-11, prescribes conditions for valid Hindu adoption including capacity of the person giving and taking in adoption. Under HAMA, an adopted child has the same rights as a biological child, including inheritance rights."
