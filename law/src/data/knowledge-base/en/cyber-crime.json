    "keywords": ["online banking fraud", "bank fraud", "UPI fraud", "phishing", "OTP fraud", "net banking", "unauthorized transaction", "debit card fraud"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "If money was stolen from your bank account, immediately call your bank's customer care to block your account and cards, then report the fraud to the cyber crime portal at cybercrime.gov.in within 3 days. The faster you report, the better your chances of getting money back.",
      "practical": "Time is critical in online banking fraud. Within the first few minutes, call your bank's 24/7 customer care helpline and ask them to block your debit card, credit card, and net banking access. Most banks have a dedicated fraud reporting number. Note down the complaint reference number. Simultaneously, report on the National Cyber Crime Helpline by calling 1930 (available 24/7). This helpline can initiate a hold on the fraudulent transaction in real-time if the money has not yet been withdrawn by the criminal.\n\nWithin 3 days, file a formal complaint on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at cybercrime.gov.in. Select 'Financial Fraud' as the category. Provide your bank account details, transaction details (amount, date, time, transaction ID), and any communication you received from the fraudster (SMS, email, WhatsApp messages). Also file a written complaint at your bank branch and get an acknowledgment. Under RBI guidelines, if you report unauthorized transactions within 3 working days, your liability is limited to zero for bank-side breaches.\n\nPreserve all evidence: take screenshots of suspicious messages, note down phone numbers that called you, save emails, and do not delete any communication. If the bank does not resolve your complaint within 30 days, escalate to the Banking Ombudsman through the RBI's Complaint Management System at cms.rbi.org.in.",
      "legal": "Online banking fraud in India is primarily prosecuted under the Information Technology Act, 2000. Section 66C covers identity theft (punishment up to 3 years imprisonment and fine up to Rs. 1 lakh), Section 66D covers cheating by personation using computer resources (up to 3 years and Rs. 1 lakh fine), and Section 43 provides for compensation to affected persons. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (BNS) Section 318 (cheating) and Section 319 (cheating by personation) also apply, carrying punishment up to 7 years imprisonment.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India's circular on 'Customer Protection - Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic Banking Transactions' (RBI/2017-18/15, dated July 6, 2017) is crucial. It establishes a zero-liability framework: if the breach is on the bank's side, customer liability is zero regardless of reporting time. For third-party breaches (phishing, vishing), customer liability is zero if reported within 3 working days, limited to Rs. 10,000-25,000 if reported between 4-7 days, and as per bank policy if reported after 7 days. The bank must credit the disputed amount within 10 working days of receiving the complaint.\n\nThe Supreme Court and various High Courts have consistently held banks liable for failing to implement adequate security measures. In State Bank of India v. Smt. Manisha (National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, 2023), the bank was held liable for unauthorized transactions where the customer proved they did not share OTP or credentials. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 and the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006 (now Integrated Ombudsman Scheme, 2021) provide additional remedies."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "If someone is misusing your Aadhaar, PAN, or other identity documents, lock your Aadhaar biometrics immediately on the UIDAI website, report to the cyber crime portal, and file an FIR. You are not liable for loans or accounts fraudulently opened in your name.",
      "practical": "First, limit the damage. If your Aadhaar is being misused, go to myaadhaar.uidai.gov.in and lock your biometric authentication immediately. This prevents anyone from using your fingerprints or iris scan for any Aadhaar-based verification. You can also lock your Aadhaar number itself using the Virtual ID feature. If your PAN is compromised, check your Form 26AS on the Income Tax portal (incometax.gov.in) to see if any unknown transactions or TDS entries appear.\n\nCheck your credit score and credit report on CIBIL (cibil.com), Experian, Equifax, or CRIF High Mark. If you find loans or credit cards taken in your name that you did not authorize, raise a dispute with the credit bureau immediately and complain to the respective bank or NBFC. You can also place a fraud alert on your credit file so that lenders must verify your identity more stringently before issuing credit.\n\nFile a complaint on cybercrime.gov.in and at your nearest police station. Request an FIR under Section 66C of the IT Act (identity theft). Keep copies of the FIR and send them to any financial institution where fraudulent accounts have been opened. Write to UIDAI at help@uidai.gov.in reporting the Aadhaar misuse. Also file a complaint with the Data Protection Board if your data was leaked by any organization.",
      "legal": "Identity theft is a specific criminal offence under Section 66C of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which states: 'Whoever, fraudulently or dishonestly make use of the electronic signature, password or any other unique identification feature of any other person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to rupees one lakh.' Section 66D covers cheating by personation using computer resources.\n\nThe Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 provides specific protections. Section 29 prohibits sharing of core biometric information and Aadhaar numbers. Section 40-41 prescribe penalties for unauthorized access to the Central Identities Data Repository (up to 10 years imprisonment and Rs. 10 crore fine) and for tampering with data. The UIDAI has also established a grievance redressal mechanism through the Aadhaar Act.\n\nThe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA) provides individuals with the right to know what personal data is being processed, the right to correction and erasure, and the right to grievance redressal. If any data fiduciary (organization) is responsible for a data breach leading to identity theft, they can be penalized up to Rs. 250 crore by the Data Protection Board. Under BNS Section 318 (cheating) and Section 336 (forgery), criminal prosecution can also be initiated. The Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) 10 SCC 1 recognized the fundamental right to privacy, which strengthens the legal framework for identity protection."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "Online bullying, harassment, and threats are crimes under Indian law. You can file a complaint on cybercrime.gov.in or at the nearest police station. Take screenshots of everything as evidence before the bully deletes their posts.",
      "practical": "If you are being harassed online, the most important first step is preserving evidence. Take screenshots of every abusive message, post, comment, or email with timestamps clearly visible. Save URLs and take screen recordings if needed. If the harassment is on social media, download your data or use archive tools. Do not delete any messages, even if they are disturbing. This evidence is critical for any legal action.\n\nReport the abusive content on the social media platform itself using their reporting tools. Most platforms like Instagram, Facebook, X (Twitter), and YouTube have policies against harassment and will take down content and suspend accounts. But do not rely solely on the platform. File a formal complaint on cybercrime.gov.in (select 'Women/Child Related Crime' or 'Other Cyber Crime' as applicable) and also file an FIR at your local police station. If the police refuse to register an FIR, send your complaint by registered post to the Superintendent of Police.\n\nIf the harassment involves sexual content, morphed images, or threats of violence, these are serious offences carrying higher penalties. Women can also file complaints under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act if the harasser is a partner or family member, or under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act if the harassment is from a colleague. Minors should involve parents or guardians and can seek protection under POCSO if the content is sexual in nature.",
      "legal": "Cyberbullying and online harassment are covered under multiple Indian laws. The Information Technology Act, 2000, Section 67 punishes publishing obscene material (up to 5 years imprisonment and Rs. 10 lakh fine on second conviction). Section 67A covers sexually explicit material (up to 7 years and Rs. 10 lakh fine). Section 67B specifically addresses depicting children in sexually explicit acts (up to 7 years). Section 66E punishes violation of privacy by capturing or publishing private images (up to 3 years and Rs. 2 lakh fine).\n\nThe Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 provides additional remedies. Section 351 (criminal intimidation) covers threats made online. Section 356 (defamation) applies to false statements damaging reputation. Section 79 (word, gesture, or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) applies to gendered harassment. Section 78-79 cover stalking, including cyberstalking, with punishment up to 3 years for first offence and 5 years for repeat offence. For obscene communications to women, Section 294 (obscene acts and songs) can be invoked.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015) 5 SCC 1 struck down Section 66A of the IT Act as unconstitutional but clarified that other sections like 66C, 66D, 67, 67A, and 67B remain valid. The IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 mandate social media intermediaries to take down content within 24 hours if it involves nudity, sexual content, or impersonation, and within 72 hours for other complaints. If the intermediary fails to act, they lose their safe harbor protection under Section 79 of the IT Act."

      "practical": "Start by reporting the fake profile directly to the social media platform. Every major platform has a specific option for reporting impersonation: on Facebook, go to the fake profile and select 'Find support or report' then 'Pretending to be someone'; on Instagram, use 'Report' then 'It is pretending to be someone I know'; on X (Twitter), file a report under 'Impersonation.' Under the IT Intermediary Guidelines, platforms must acknowledge complaints within 24 hours and resolve impersonation complaints within 15 days.\n\nIf the fake profile is being used to share obscene content, defame you, or harass others in your name, the matter becomes more urgent. File a complaint on cybercrime.gov.in with screenshots of the fake profile, your real profile for comparison, and any evidence of the fake profile being used to send messages or post content. Also file an FIR at your local police station.\n\nIf you can identify who created the fake profile, you can also send them a legal notice demanding removal and compensation for damages to your reputation. If the identity is unknown, the police can request the social media platform to disclose the IP address and account creation details under Section 91 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023. Consider also filing a civil suit for defamation and injunction.",
      "legal": "Social media impersonation is punishable under Section 66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which covers cheating by personation by using a computer resource (punishment up to 3 years imprisonment and fine up to Rs. 1 lakh).

Under the BNS 2023, Section 319 (cheating by personation) carries up to 7 years imprisonment, and Section 356 (defamation) provides for up to 2 years imprisonment.\n\nThe Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, Rule 3(1)(b)(ii) specifically prohibits content that impersonates another person. Rule 3(2)(b) requires intermediaries to remove such content within 72 hours of receiving a complaint (24 hours for content involving nudity or sexual content). If the intermediary fails to act, they lose their safe harbor protection under Section 79 of the IT Act and can be held liable.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Karmanya Singh Sareen v. Union of India (2016) addressed social media privacy concerns. Various High Courts have granted injunctions against fake profiles. In Komal Rastogi v. Unknown (Delhi High Court, 2018), the court directed social media platforms to take down fake profiles and provide user data to assist investigation. The Madras High Court in S. Karthikeyan v. Secretary to Government (2017) directed police to register FIR for online impersonation even when the complainant could not identify the perpetrator."

      "practical": "If you believe a company is misusing your personal data, start by exercising your rights under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023. You have the right to know what personal data is being collected about you and for what purpose. You have the right to correction of inaccurate data. You have the right to erasure (deletion) of your data when it is no longer needed.

Send a written request clearly stating which right you are exercising. The company must respond within a reasonable time. If they collect data without consent, share it with third parties without your permission, or fail to protect it from breaches, they are violating the law.\n\nIf the company does not respond or refuses to comply, you can file a complaint with the Data Protection Board of India. For unsolicited marketing calls and messages, register on the Do Not Disturb (DND) list by sending 'START 0' to 1909 from your phone or through the TRAI DND app. If companies continue to spam you after DND registration, file a complaint on the TRAI DND app. For serious data breaches affecting many people, consider filing a Public Interest Litigation.",

This landmark judgment held that privacy includes informational privacy, which covers the right to control the dissemination of personal information.\n\nThe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA) is India's comprehensive data protection law. It applies to digital personal data collected within India and to processing outside India if it relates to offering goods or services in India. Key provisions include: Section 4 requires lawful purpose and consent for processing personal data; Section 5 mandates notice to the data principal (individual) before collection; Section 6 requires free, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent; Sections 11-14 provide rights including right to information, correction, erasure, grievance redressal, and nomination. Data fiduciaries (companies) must implement reasonable security safeguards and notify the Data Protection Board of any breach. Penalties range up to Rs. 250 crore for failure to protect against data breaches.\n\nAdditionally, the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 under Section 43A of the IT Act require bodies corporate to implement reasonable security practices. Failure makes them liable for compensation. TRAI's Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 govern unsolicited commercial communications.
