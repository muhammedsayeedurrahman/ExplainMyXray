    "keywords": ["defective product", "faulty product", "broken product", "product defect", "manufacturing defect", "warranty", "replacement", "refund"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "If you buy a product that is defective or does not work as promised, you have the right to get a replacement, refund, or compensation from the seller or manufacturer. Indian consumer law strongly protects buyers against defective goods.",
      "practical": "If you have purchased a defective product, you have several options under Indian consumer law. First, contact the seller or manufacturer directly and request a replacement, repair, or refund. Put your complaint in writing (email or letter) and keep a copy. If the product is under warranty, the manufacturer is obligated to repair or replace it free of cost.\n\nIf the seller or manufacturer does not respond satisfactorily within a reasonable time (typically 15-30 days), you can file a consumer complaint. Keep all evidence — the purchase bill or receipt, warranty card, photographs or videos of the defect, any communication with the seller, and the product itself. You do not need a lawyer to file a consumer complaint, and the fee is minimal (ranging from nil to Rs. 5,000 depending on the claim amount).\n\nFile your complaint at the appropriate Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission based on the value of goods and compensation claimed — District Commission for claims up to Rs. 1 crore, State Commission for Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 10 crore, and National Commission for above Rs. 10 crore. You can also file complaints online through the e-daakhil portal (edaakhil.nic.in) or the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.",
      "legal": "The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (replacing the 1986 Act) is the governing legislation. Section 2(10) defines 'defect' as any fault, imperfection, or shortcoming in quality, quantity, potency, purity, or standard required under any law or claimed by the trader. Section 2(7) defines a 'consumer' broadly, including any person who buys goods or hires services for consideration, including online transactions.\n\nSection 38 provides for reliefs including: removal of defect, replacement, refund of price, payment of compensation for loss or injury, discontinuation of unfair trade practices, and adequate costs. Under Section 84, product liability actions can be brought against manufacturers, product sellers, and product service providers. Section 86 places strict liability on the manufacturer for harm caused by defective products, including liability for failure to warn about dangers and for design defects.\n\nThe concept of product liability was expanded in the 2019 Act (Chapter VI, Sections 82-87). Under Section 87, a product manufacturer is liable if the product contains a manufacturing defect, is defective in design, or deviates from manufacturing specifications. In Maruti Udyog Ltd. v. Susheel Kumar Gabgotra (2006), the National Commission held the manufacturer liable for a manufacturing defect despite the vehicle being used for some time. In General Motors (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. Ashok Ramnik Lal Tolat (2015), the manufacturer was held liable for a latent defect discovered after the warranty period."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "If a seller or company tricks you with false advertising, hidden charges, fake discounts, or misleading claims about their product or service, it is an unfair trade practice. You can file a complaint and get compensation.",
      "practical": "Unfair trade practices cover a wide range of deceptive business behaviors — false or misleading advertisements, fake discounts (showing inflated MRP and then offering a 'discount'), hidden charges added at checkout, bait and switch tactics (advertising one product and selling another), selling goods not meeting promised standards, and not honoring warranties or guarantees.\n\nIf you have been a victim, start by documenting everything. Take screenshots of advertisements, offers, or claims made by the seller. Keep records of what was promised versus what was delivered. Save bills, receipts, email confirmations, and chat transcripts. Write a formal complaint to the company and allow them 15 days to respond.\n\nIf the company does not resolve the issue, you have multiple avenues. File a consumer complaint with the appropriate Consumer Commission. For misleading advertisements, you can also file a complaint with the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) through ascionline.in. For serious fraud, file a complaint with the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) which has the power to recall products, reimburse buyers, and impose penalties on the company. The CCPA can also issue directions against false or misleading advertisements and impose penalties up to Rs. 10 lakh on the manufacturer and Rs. 50 lakh on the endorser.",
      "legal": "The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 defines 'unfair trade practice' under Section 2(47), which includes: false representation about quality, standard, or grade of goods; false claims about sponsorship, approval, or affiliation; making false or misleading representations about the need for goods or services; not disclosing important information; permitting publication of advertisements which are misleading; and hoarding or destroying goods to raise costs.\n\nSection 18 establishes the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) with the power to protect consumer rights, prevent unfair trade practices, and regulate misleading advertisements. Under Section 21, the CCPA can impose a penalty of up to Rs. 10 lakh on a manufacturer or endorser for false or misleading advertisements, and up to Rs. 50 lakh for subsequent offences. Section 21(2) can prohibit the endorser of a misleading advertisement from making any endorsement for up to 1 year (3 years for subsequent violation).\n\nThe 2019 Act also addresses 'product liability' in Chapter VI and 'unfair contracts' in Section 2(46) — contracts with unreasonable terms like excessive security deposits, disproportionate penalties, unilateral termination rights, or one-sided indemnity clauses. In Vodafone Mobile Services Ltd. v. Consumer Education and Research Centre (2009), the National Commission held hidden charges and unilateral modification of plans as unfair trade practices."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "You can file a consumer complaint online through the e-daakhil portal or in person at the Consumer Commission in your district. The process is simple, you do not need a lawyer, and the filing fees are very low.",
      "practical": "Filing a consumer complaint in India is straightforward and designed to be accessible. You can file it yourself without a lawyer. First, determine the right forum based on the value of goods/services plus compensation claimed — District Commission for up to Rs. 1 crore, State Commission for Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 10 crore, and National Commission for above Rs. 10 crore.\n\nThe easiest method is filing online through the e-daakhil portal (edaakhil.nic.in). Create an account, fill in the complaint form, upload supporting documents (bills, receipts, photos, correspondence), and pay the fee online. Filing fees range from nil (for claims up to Rs. 5 lakh) to Rs. 5,000 (for claims up to Rs. 1 crore). Alternatively, you can file in person by submitting a typed or handwritten complaint on plain paper at the Consumer Commission office along with copies of supporting documents.\n\nYour complaint should include: your name and address, the name and address of the opposite party (seller/manufacturer/service provider), a clear description of the complaint with dates, the relief you are seeking (refund, replacement, compensation), and copies of all supporting documents. The complaint must be filed within 2 years of the cause of action. After filing, the Commission will issue notice to the opposite party who must respond within 30 days. Most cases are resolved within 3-5 months.",
      "legal": "The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 governs the filing of consumer complaints. Section 34 establishes the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Section 47 the State Commission, and Section 53 the National Commission. The pecuniary jurisdiction is defined in Sections 34(1), 47(1)(a), and 58(1)(a) — District up to Rs. 1 crore, State Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 10 crore, and National above Rs. 10 crore.\n\nSection 35 specifies who can file a complaint — the consumer, any recognized consumer association, the Central or State Government, the Central Authority, and one or more consumers having the same interest (class action). Section 35(2) provides for the filing of complaints electronically. Section 69(1) prescribes a limitation period of 2 years from the date on which the cause of action arises, with the Commission having the power to condone delay under Section 69(2) if sufficient cause is shown.\n\nThe Consumer Protection (Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission) Rules, 2020 prescribe court fees — nil for claims up to Rs. 5 lakh, Rs. 200 for Rs. 5-10 lakh, Rs. 400 for Rs. 10-20 lakh, Rs. 1,000 for Rs. 20-50 lakh, Rs. 2,000 for Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 1 crore, and Rs. 2,500 for Rs. 1-2 crore, going up to Rs. 7,500 for claims above Rs. 10 crore. In Sprint RPG India Ltd. v. Romi Jain (2021), the National Commission held that consumer complaints must be disposed of within the timelines specified in the Act — within 3 months if no testing is required and 5 months if testing is required."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "When you shop online, you have the same consumer rights as buying from a physical store — plus additional protections. If you receive a defective, wrong, or different product, you are entitled to a full refund or replacement regardless of the seller's return policy.",
      "practical": "E-commerce consumer protection in India has been significantly strengthened. When you buy online, the seller must provide accurate product descriptions, clear pricing (no hidden charges), the total cost including taxes and delivery, and details of the return/refund/exchange policy before you make a purchase. You must receive a confirmation with order details and an estimated delivery date.\n\nIf you receive a defective product, a product that does not match the description, or a different product than what you ordered, you are entitled to a refund or replacement. This right exists regardless of the seller's stated return policy. To claim a refund, first use the platform's grievance redressal mechanism — most platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and others have an online return and refund process. If the platform does not resolve your issue within a reasonable time (typically 30 days), escalate to the platform's Grievance Officer.\n\nIf the platform still does not resolve the issue, file a consumer complaint with the Consumer Commission. You can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000, which has direct integration with most major e-commerce platforms. For payment-related issues (amount debited but order not confirmed, refund not credited), also contact your bank and file a chargeback request.",
      "legal": "The Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 issued under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 specifically govern e-commerce transactions. Rule 4 imposes duties on e-commerce entities including: displaying seller details, accurate product descriptions, total price with breakup, return/refund/exchange policy, available payment methods, and grievance redressal mechanism. Rule 4(4) prohibits imposing cancellation charges on consumers unless similar charges are borne by the e-commerce entity for its own cancellation.\n\nRule 5 mandates that marketplace e-commerce entities must: ensure sellers have no deceptive page arrangements, maintain a level playing field, provide an adequate grievance redressal mechanism with an appointed Grievance Officer who must acknowledge complaints within 48 hours and resolve within 1 month. Rule 6 deals with inventory e-commerce entities and requires them to accept the return of goods and refund consideration if the goods are defective, delivered late, or do not match the description.\n\nThe Consumer Protection Act, 2019 Section 2(7)(ii) specifically includes online transactions within the definition of 'consumer'. Section 2(16) defines 'e-commerce' as buying or selling of goods or services including digital products over digital or electronic network. In Ashish Ahuja v. Snapdeal (2016), the National Commission held that e-commerce platforms can be held liable as intermediaries if they fail to take reasonable care. The Information Technology Act, 2000 read with IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 also applies to e-commerce platforms."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "If a doctor or hospital causes you harm through careless or negligent treatment, you have the right to compensation. Medical services fall under consumer protection law, and you can file a complaint against the doctor, hospital, or both.",
      "practical": "Medical negligence occurs when a doctor or hospital fails to provide the standard of care that a reasonably competent medical professional would have provided in the same situation, causing injury or harm to the patient. This can include wrong diagnosis, wrong treatment, surgical errors, failure to obtain informed consent, failure to refer to a specialist, administering wrong medication, or post-operative negligence.\n\nIf you suspect medical negligence, immediately get a second medical opinion from another qualified doctor. Obtain certified copies of all medical records — the hospital is legally obligated to provide these under Section 1.3 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002. Collect all bills, prescriptions, discharge summaries, and diagnostic reports. If the patient has died, ensure a post-mortem report is obtained.\n\nYou can pursue multiple remedies simultaneously: (1) File a consumer complaint with the Consumer Commission — this is the simplest and quickest route. (2) File a complaint with the State Medical Council, which can suspend or revoke the doctor's license. (3) File a criminal complaint under Section 304A IPC (now Section 106 BNS) for death caused by negligence, or Section 337/338 IPC (now Sections 125/126 BNS) for causing hurt by negligence. (4) File a civil suit for damages in a civil court.",
      "legal": "Medical services fall within the purview of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 as held in Indian Medical Association v. V.P. Shantha (1995) by the Supreme Court. Both the doctor and the hospital can be held liable for medical negligence. Section 2(42) defines 'service' which includes medical services (except free treatment at government hospitals). The standard for determining negligence was established in Jacob Mathew v. State of Punjab (2005) where the Supreme Court adopted the Bolam Test — a medical professional is not negligent if they acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion.\n\nIn Kusum Sharma v. Batra Hospital (2010), the Supreme Court laid down principles: the standard is that of an ordinary competent doctor exercising ordinary skill, not the highest expert skill. The burden of proving negligence lies on the complainant. Mere deviation from normal practice is not necessarily negligence, but failure to follow basic protocols can be. In Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences v. Prasanth S. Dhananka (2009), the Supreme Court awarded Rs. 1 crore compensation for medical negligence — one of the highest awards in Indian medical negligence cases.\n\nCriminal prosecution for medical negligence requires a higher degree of negligence — 'gross negligence' or 'recklessness' as held in Jacob Mathew (supra). Simple negligence or an error of judgment does not attract criminal liability. Section 304A IPC (Section 106 BNS) for causing death by negligent act is punishable with imprisonment up to 2 years, or fine, or both. The Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 also mandates minimum standards for healthcare facilities."
