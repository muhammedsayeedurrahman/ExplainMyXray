    "keywords": ["minimum wage", "minimum pay", "low salary", "underpaid", "wage rate", "floor wage", "daily wage", "monthly wage"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "Every worker in India is entitled to a minimum wage set by the government. Your employer must pay at least this amount, and it varies by state, skill level, and type of work. If you are paid less, your employer is breaking the law.",
      "practical": "Minimum wages in India are fixed by both the Central and State governments depending on the industry and location. The rates vary based on the type of work (unskilled, semi-skilled, skilled, highly skilled) and the geographic zone. For example, in Delhi the minimum wage for unskilled workers is approximately Rs. 17,494 per month (as of recent notification), while it differs in other states.\n\nTo check if you are being paid fairly, visit the Labour Department website of your state or the Ministry of Labour and Employment website (labour.gov.in). Find the minimum wage notification applicable to your industry and skill category. Your employer must display the minimum wage rates at a prominent place in the workplace. Wages must be paid on time — within 7 days of the end of the wage period for establishments with fewer than 1,000 workers, and within 10 days for larger establishments.\n\nIf you are being paid below minimum wage, you can file a complaint with the Labour Commissioner or the Inspector under the Minimum Wages Act. You can also call the national labour helpline SHRAM at 14434. The employer can be penalized with fines and imprisonment for paying below minimum wage.",
      "legal": "The Minimum Wages Act, 1948 (to be replaced by the Code on Wages, 2019, once notified) empowers both Central and State Governments to fix minimum rates of wages for scheduled employments. Section 12 mandates that the employer shall pay to every employee wages at a rate not less than the minimum rate of wages fixed. Section 20 provides for filing of claims by employees before the Authority appointed under the Act.\n\nUnder Section 22, paying below minimum wages is punishable with imprisonment up to 6 months, or a fine up to Rs. 500, or both. The Code on Wages, 2019 (once fully implemented) introduces the concept of a 'floor wage' under Section 9 — no State Government can fix a minimum wage below this national floor wage. Section 54 of the Code on Wages provides enhanced penalties — up to Rs. 50,000 fine for first violation and up to 3 months imprisonment for subsequent violations.\n\nIn People's Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (1982), the Supreme Court held that paying less than minimum wages is a form of forced labour violating Article 23 of the Constitution. In Bijay Cotton Mills Ltd. v. State of Ajmer (1955), the Court upheld the constitutional validity of the Minimum Wages Act. The Payment of Wages Act, 1936 further ensures timely payment and restricts unauthorized deductions from wages."

    "keywords": ["wrongful termination", "fired", "illegal termination", "retrenchment", "notice period", "termination without notice", "unfair dismissal", "laid off"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "Your employer cannot fire you without following proper procedures — they must give you notice, pay due compensation, and have a valid reason. If you have been wrongfully terminated, you can challenge it and may get your job back or compensation.",
      "practical": "If you believe you have been wrongfully terminated, first check whether your termination followed the legal procedure. For workers in establishments with 100 or more employees (in many states this threshold applies under the Industrial Disputes Act), the employer needs prior government permission for retrenchment. For other workers, the employer must give at least one month's notice or pay in lieu of notice, plus retrenchment compensation of 15 days' average pay for every completed year of service.\n\nImmediately after termination, send a written letter to your employer objecting to the termination and requesting reinstatement. Keep copies of your appointment letter, pay slips, ID card, termination letter, and any other employment records. If you were terminated verbally without a written order, send a letter to the employer asking for written reasons.\n\nYou can raise an industrial dispute through the Labour Commissioner by filing a complaint. The conciliation officer will first try to mediate. If conciliation fails, the matter goes to the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal. You can also approach the Labour Court directly in some cases. If the termination is found illegal, you may be entitled to reinstatement with full back wages.",
      "legal": "The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (to be replaced by the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, once notified) is the primary law governing termination of workers. Section 25F requires that for retrenchment of any workman, the employer must give one month's written notice or pay in lieu of notice, and pay retrenchment compensation equal to 15 days' average pay for every completed year of continuous service. Section 25G requires the 'last come, first go' principle.\n\nSection 25N requires prior permission of the appropriate Government before retrenching any workman in establishments employing 100 or more workers (threshold varies by state — some states have raised it to 300). Retrenchment without permission is void ab initio under Section 25N(7). Section 25H gives retrenched workers a right to re-employment. For dismissal due to misconduct, Section 2(oo) read with the principles of natural justice require a domestic inquiry with fair opportunity of hearing.\n\nIn Workmen v. Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. (1973), the Supreme Court held that the burden of proving that termination is justified lies on the employer. In Uptron India Ltd. v. Shammi Bhan (1998), the Court held that termination by way of simple notice is not permitted where it is actually punitive in nature. Under Section 11A, the Labour Court can set aside the order of termination and direct reinstatement with or without back wages if it finds the termination unjustified."

    "keywords": ["overtime", "extra hours", "working hours", "overtime pay", "double wages", "rest day", "weekly off", "extra work"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "Indian law limits your working hours to 8-9 hours a day and 48 hours a week. Any work beyond this is overtime, and your employer must pay you at double the normal rate for overtime hours.",
      "practical": "Under Indian labour law, no worker should work more than 48 hours in a week or 9 hours in a day (8 hours for factories). Every worker is entitled to at least one day off per week. If your employer asks you to work beyond these limits, they must pay you overtime wages at twice your ordinary rate of wages.\n\nTo claim overtime, start by maintaining your own record of actual working hours — note the time you arrive, leave, and any break periods. Compare this with your employer's attendance register. Check your pay slips to see if overtime has been properly calculated and paid. Many employers try to avoid overtime by designating workers as 'supervisors' or putting them on fixed salaries — but the law looks at actual duties, not designations.\n\nIf your employer is not paying overtime, raise the issue in writing first. If that does not work, file a complaint with the Labour Inspector of your area. You can also call the SHRAM helpline at 14434. The employer is required to maintain registers of overtime work and display working hour notices prominently. Under the Factories Act, total hours including overtime cannot exceed 60 hours per week and the total overtime in a quarter cannot exceed 75 hours.",
      "legal": "The Factories Act, 1948 governs working hours for factory workers — Section 51 limits weekly hours to 48, Section 54 limits daily hours to 9, and Section 59 mandates overtime payment at twice the ordinary rate. Section 52 mandates a weekly holiday. Section 64 restricts total overtime to 75 hours per quarter (some states have relaxed this limit). The Shops and Establishments Acts of respective states govern overtime for non-factory workers with broadly similar provisions.\n\nThe Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 (once fully notified) consolidates these provisions. Section 25 limits daily work to 8 hours and Section 26 provides for overtime at twice the ordinary rate. The Code on Wages, 2019 under Section 14 also mandates overtime at not less than twice the normal rate.\n\nIn Basti Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. Ram Ujagar (1964), the Supreme Court held that overtime wages must be paid at double the ordinary rate without any conditions. In Crown Aluminium Works v. Workmen (1958), the Court held that the calculation of overtime rate must include basic wages plus dearness allowance. An employer cannot compel a worker to forgo overtime through any contract or agreement, as held in Manager, Reserve Bank of India v. S. Kumar (2005)."

    "answer": {
      "simple": "Every worker has the right to a safe workplace. Your employer must provide safety equipment, maintain clean and safe conditions, and compensate you if you are injured at work. You can refuse dangerous work and report unsafe conditions.",
      "practical": "Your employer is legally required to provide a safe working environment — this includes proper ventilation, lighting, clean drinking water, toilets, first aid, fire safety equipment, and protective gear relevant to your work. For hazardous industries, additional safeguards like safety training, health checkups, and specialized protective equipment are mandatory.\n\nIf you notice unsafe conditions at your workplace, first bring it to the attention of your supervisor or manager in writing. If the employer does not act, you can report the issue to the Factory Inspector or the Labour Department. In case of imminent danger, you have the right to refuse to work without being penalized. Every factory with 250 or more workers must have a Safety Committee with worker representatives.\n\nIf you are injured at work, you are entitled to compensation regardless of who was at fault. Under the Employees' Compensation Act, the employer must pay for medical treatment and compensate you for disability or death. Report any workplace injury immediately to your employer and get medical treatment documented. Compensation can include payment for temporary disability, permanent disability, or in case of death, payment to your dependents.",
      "legal": "The Factories Act, 1948 contains comprehensive safety provisions in Chapter IV (Sections 11-20) covering cleanliness, ventilation, temperature, dust and fume control, overcrowding, lighting, drinking water, latrines, urinals, and spittoons. Chapter IV-A (Sections 41A-41H) deals with hazardous processes including the requirement of safety committees, disclosure of information to workers, and medical examination of workers.\n\nThe Employees' Compensation Act, 1923 (formerly Workmen's Compensation Act) provides for compensation to workers injured in the course of employment. Section 3 creates a no-fault liability — the employer must compensate even if the injury was not caused by the employer's negligence. Compensation for death is 50% of the monthly wage multiplied by the relevant factor (based on age), with a minimum of Rs. 1,20,000. For permanent total disability, it is 60% of monthly wage multiplied by the relevant factor, with a minimum of Rs. 1,40,000. Claims must be filed before the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation.\n\nThe Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 (once notified) will consolidate 13 existing labour laws relating to safety. It mandates a duty on every employer to provide a safe workplace free from hazards (Section 6), annual health examinations (Section 6(1)(e)), and appointment of safety officers. In Consumer Education and Research Centre v. Union of India (1995), the Supreme Court held that the right to health and safe working conditions is a fundamental right under Article 21."

    "question": "When am I entitled to gratuity and how is it calculated?",
    "keywords": ["gratuity", "retirement benefit", "5 years", "gratuity calculation", "gratuity payment", "terminal benefit", "resignation gratuity"],
    "answer": {
      "simple": "If you have worked for an employer for 5 or more years, you are entitled to a gratuity payment when you leave. The amount is calculated based on your last drawn salary and years of service, up to a maximum of Rs. 20 lakh.",
      "practical": "Gratuity is a retirement or terminal benefit payable when you leave your job after completing at least 5 continuous years of service with the same employer. This applies regardless of whether you resign, retire, or are terminated (except for termination due to serious misconduct like moral turpitude). In case of death or disability, the 5-year condition is waived.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward: Last drawn salary (basic + dearness allowance) multiplied by 15, divided by 26, multiplied by the number of years of service. For example, if your last drawn salary (basic + DA) is Rs. 30,000 and you worked for 10 years, your gratuity would be Rs. 30,000 x 15/26 x 10 = Rs. 1,73,077. Service of more than 6 months in the last year is rounded up to a full year. The maximum gratuity is Rs. 20 lakh.\n\nTo claim gratuity, send a written application (Form I) to your employer within 30 days of it becoming payable (this deadline is not strict — late applications are also accepted). The employer must pay within 30 days of the application. If the employer delays or denies payment, they must pay with interest. If there is a dispute, you can approach the Controlling Authority (usually the Labour Commissioner) for resolution.",
      "legal": "The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 applies to every factory, mine, oilfield, plantation, port, railway company, and every shop or establishment with 10 or more employees. Section 4(1) provides that gratuity shall be payable to an employee on termination of employment after not less than 5 years of continuous service — on superannuation, retirement, resignation, death, or disablement. Section 4(1) proviso waives the 5-year requirement in cases of death or disablement.\n\nSection 4(2) provides the formula: gratuity = last drawn wages x 15/26 x completed years of service (with part of a year exceeding 6 months counted as a full year). Section 4(3) caps gratuity at Rs. 20,00,000 (as amended in 2018). Section 4(6) provides that gratuity can be forfeited wholly or partly if the employee's services are terminated for riotous or disorderly conduct, or for any act of moral turpitude committed during the course of employment.\n\nSection 7(2) requires the employer to determine the amount and pay within 30 days — failure to pay within this period attracts simple interest from the due date. Section 7(3A) provides that if the employer does not pay despite a notice from the Controlling Authority, a certificate for recovery shall be issued to the Collector. In Surinder Singh Chopra v. Punjab National Bank (2009), the Supreme Court emphasized that gratuity is a statutory right and cannot be denied except on legally specified grounds."
